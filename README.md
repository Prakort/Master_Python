# Master_Python

## Steps:
#### Clarify the question

- State a concrete example of the question e.g return the max element in the list then if input array is [1,2,3] then return 3 the index of 2

- Ask for complexity that the interviewer is looking for.

#### Work on concrete examples:

- [1,2,3,5,6] traverse the list and we get 6 is the max

#### Spell out the brute-force solution:

- Explain the brute-force first then find a more efficient solution later 

#### Think out loud:

- Help the interviewer guide your thought process in the right direction.

#### Apply patterns:

- Use general reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems

# Test for corner cases/egde cases:

- Binary search code fails if the inpjt is an empty array or overflow
